##### Longest common subsequence
1. Given two strings str1 and str2, find the length of their longest common subsequence.
   A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order but not necessarily contiguous and a common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
```
use two pointers to recursively match characters in string
if both chars matches: move to next in both
else: move to next in each string separately
i--> s1 and j-->s2
if s1[i]==s2[j]:
  return 1+f(i-1,j-1)
else
  return max( f(i-1,j), f(i,j-1) )
```
##### Longest common substring
2. Given two strings str1 and str2, find the length of their longest common substring.
   A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
```
when two chars don't match we lost the contingousness and return 0;
but the answer is not guaranteed at f(m-1,n-1) answer can be from any f(i,j) for i->0 to m-1 and j->0 to n-1

Use tabulation:
set dp[i][j]=0 when s1[i]!=s2[j]
answer is the max value in entire dp array.
```
##### Longest palindromic subsequence
3. Given a string, Find the longest palindromic subsequence length in given string.
   A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backwards as forward
```
find the lcs of string and reverse of given string
```
##### Minimum insertions to make string palindrome
4. Given a string s, find the minimum number of insertions needed to make it a palindrome.
```
Ans = size of string - Longest palindromic subsequence
```
##### Minimum insertions or deletions to convert string A to B
