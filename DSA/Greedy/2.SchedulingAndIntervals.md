### Shortest Job First
A software engineer is tasked with using the shortest job first (SJF) policy to calculate the average waiting time for each process. The shortest job first also known as shortest job next (SJN) scheduling policy selects the waiting process with the least execution time to run next.

Given an array of n integers representing the burst times of processes, determine the average waiting time for all processes and return the closest whole number that is less than or equal to the result.
```
bt = [4, 1, 3, 7, 2]
output is avg wt  = 4

Sort the array.
[1,2,3,4,7]
now, complete each task in the same order:
1 is completed -> 4 tasks waited 1 sec | 1 x 4
2 is completed -> 3 tasks waited 2 sec | 2 x 3
3 is completed -> 2 tasks waited 3 sec | 3 x 2
4 is completed -> 1 task  waited 4 sec | 4 x 1
7 is completed -> 0 tasks waited 7 sec | 0
total = 20
avg = 20/5 = 4
```
```java
class Solution {
    public long solve(int[] bt) {
        Arrays.sort(bt);
        int n=bt.length-1;
        long wt = 0;
        for(int i:bt){
            wt += i*n;
            n--;
        }
        return (int)(wt/bt.length);
    }
}
 
```
```java
class Solution {
    public long solve(int[] bt) {
        Arrays.sort(bt);
        int n = bt.length;
        long totalTime = 0;
        long clock = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            totalTime += clock;
            clock += bt[i];
        }
        return totalTime/n;
    }
}

```
