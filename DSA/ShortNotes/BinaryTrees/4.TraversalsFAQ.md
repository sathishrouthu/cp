##### Zig Zag or Spiral Traversal
Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).
```
do the level order,
maintain flag to include elements in forward order or reverse order.

List<Integer> level = Arrays.asList(new Integer[size]);

int idx = flag ? i : size-1-i;
level.set(idx,front.data);
```

##### Boundary Traversal
Given a root of Binary Tree, perform the boundary traversal of the tree. 

The boundary traversal is the process of visiting the boundary nodes of the binary tree in the anticlockwise direction, starting from the root.
```
add Root ( if not a leave )
addLeftBoundary(root.left)
addLeaves(root)
addRightBoundary(root.right)
```

##### Vertical Order Traversal
Compute the binary tree's vertical order traversal given its root.
The left and right children of a node at location (row, col) will be at (row + 1, col - 1) and (row + 1, col + 1), respectively. The tree's root is located at (0, 0).

The vertical order traversal of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column. 
There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values. Return the binary tree's vertical order traversal.
```
create a TreeMap<Integer,TreeMap<Intger,PriorityQueue>>>
it represents:

Y --> { X --> { values } }
for each vertical level(y) there are multiple rows(x)

Traverse the map,
for each Y :
  verticalLevel = []
  for each X :
    for each PQ:
      add all elements from PQ to verticalLevel
  add verticalLevel to result;
```

##### Top View
Given the root of a binary tree, return the top view of the binary tree.
```
Maintain a map of TreeMap<Integer,Integer> => Y : firstValue at yth level
queue to level order traversal, put only first value in map at each vertical level

```
