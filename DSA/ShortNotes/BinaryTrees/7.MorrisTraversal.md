### Morris Inorder Traversal
#### Morris Inorder Traversal is a tree traversal algorithm aiming to achieve a space complexity of O(1) without recursion or an external data structure.

##### 1. Given root of binary tree, return the Inorder traversal of the binary tree. with O(1) space.
```
Iterative approach, start with curr = root;
