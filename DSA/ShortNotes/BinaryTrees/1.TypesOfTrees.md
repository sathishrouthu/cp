# Binary Trees:

##### Full Binary Tree:

Also known as a Strict Binary Tree, where every node has either zero or two children. No node of this tree has just a single child; all internal nodes have exactly two children or no children if they are leaf nodes.

##### Complete Binary Tree:

A specialised form of Binary Tree where all levels are filled completely except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right. 

##### Perfect Binary Tree:

A type of Binary Tree where all leaf nodes are at the same level and the number of leaf nodes is maximised for that level. Every node in a perfect binary tree has either zero or two children. This means that every internal node (non-leaf node) has exactly two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

##### Balanced Binary Tree:

A type of Binary Tree where the heights of the two subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This property ensures that the tree remains relatively well-balanced, preventing the tree from becoming highly skewed or degenerate.

##### Degenerate Tree:

A Binary Tree where the nodes are arranged in a single path leaning to the right or left. The tree resembles a linked list in its structure where each node points to the next node in a linear fashion.
