##### Maximum Width of Binary Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum width of the given tree.

The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.
```
number the nodes in the following way
root : 0
root.left : 1
root.right : 2
root.left.left = 3
root.left.right  = 4

      0
    /   \
   1     2
 /   \ /   \
3    4 5    6

value of a node : 2 * parentLevel number - 1 for left node and 2 * parentLevel number + 1 

at each level we take the first node number and last node number ( last-first + 1 ) is the width
but if we have skewed trees, then we might get the number very large to mark it for node;

optimal:
number the nodes in the following  format.
      0
    /   \
   0     1
 /   \ /   \
0    1 2    3

at each level the value of node at peak of the queue is the min value ( first element )
while numbering we use the following formula
value of a node :
  2 * (parentLevel number - Min) - 1 for left node
  2 * (parentLevel number - Min) + 1 for right node

```
##### Print all nodes at a distance of K in BT
Given the root of a binary tree, the value of a target node target, and an integer k. Return an array of the values of all nodes that have a distance k from the target node.
```
from the target move up/left/right
to move up we need to have parent links of each node.
track the parents in a map Map<Node, ParentNode>
maintain a set to track visited nodes.
do the level order traversal with Queue and maintain the distance;

start with target in the queue and distance=0
      
while que not empty:
      if dist == k break;
      for each node polled from que:
            check if it's left is not visited then add it's left to queue;
            check if it's right is not visited then add it's right to queue;
            check if it's parent is not visited then add it's parent to queue;
            since we moved to once node away: increment the distance by 1;
all the nodes remained in the que are the nodes at distance K.
```

##### Minimum time taken to burn the BT from a given Node
Given a target node data and a root of binary tree. If the target is set on fire, determine the shortest amount of time needed to burn the entire binary tree.

It is known that in 1 second all nodes connected to a given node get burned. That is its left child, right child, and parent.
```
Similar to prev problem
do not stop until queue becomes empty.
start with time=0 and at each level increment the time++;
when the queue becomes empty time is the anwer
```
