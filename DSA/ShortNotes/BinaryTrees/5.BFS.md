##### Maximum Width of Binary Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum width of the given tree.

The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.
```
number the nodes in the following way
root : 0
root.left : 1
root.right : 2
root.left.left = 3
root.left.right  = 4

      0
    /   \
   1     2
 /   \ /   \
3    4 5    6

value of a node : 2 * parentLevel number - 1 for left node and 2 * parentLevel number + 1 

at each level we take the first node number and last node number ( last-first + 1 ) is the width
but if we have skewed trees, then we might get the number very large to mark it for node;

optimal:
number the nodes in the following  format.
      0
    /   \
   0     1
 /   \ /   \
0    1 2    3

at each level the value of node at peak of the queue is the min value ( first element )
while numbering we use the following formula
value of a node :
  2 * (parentLevel number - Min) - 1 for left node
  2 * (parentLevel number - Min) + 1 for right node

```
