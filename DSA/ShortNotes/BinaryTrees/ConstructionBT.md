##### Requirements needed to construct a unique BT
```
We should have either
inorder + pre-order
OR
inorder + post-order
to construct a unique binary tree.
```

##### Construct a BT from Preorder and Inorder
Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder. Where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same tree.

Construct and return the binary tree using in-order and preorder arrays.
