##### Maximum Depth in BT
Given root of the binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is number of nodes along the longest path from from root node down to the farthest node.
```
MAX = 1 + findHeight(root.left,root.right);

```
##### Check if two trees are identical or not
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.
```
both should reach null at same time
both should have same value at every time.

if both became null return true;
if one of them became null return false;
if their values doesn't match return false;
check left of both trees and right of both trees.
```
##### Check for balanced binary tree
Given a binary tree root, find if it is height-balanced or not.

A tree is height-balanced if the difference between the heights of left and right subtrees is not more than one for all nodes of the tree. 
```
Bruteforce:
  get height of left and right at each node and compare them.

Optimal:
  while getting height recursively,
    if at any point absolute difference between left and right heights became > 1 : return -1 instead of height;
    if you get left height or right height as -1 : then return -1;
ultimately if tree is not balanced height(root) will get -1;
```
##### Diameter of Binary Tree
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. It may or may not pass through the root.
```
Bruteforce : find left height and right heigh at each node and calculate diameter as lh+rh : O(N^2)

Optimal: maintain a global variable maxi while finding height of tree.
MAXI = max(lh+rh, MAXI)

```
##### Maximum path sum
In a binary tree, a path is a list of nodes where there is an edge between every pair of neighbouring nodes. A node may only make a single appearance in the sequence. 
The total of each node's values along a path is its path sum. Return the largest path sum of all non-empty paths given the root of a binary tree.

Note: The path does not have to go via the root. Nodes may contain negative values.
```
find the maxSum on the left;
find the maxSum on the right;
currPath Sum = root.data + leftMax + rightMax

```
##### Check for symmetrical BTs
Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).
```
check if root.left and root.right are identical but since we are checking for symmetry (mirror)
instead of checking (p.left,q.left) and (p.right,p.right) to be identical recursively,
we need to check for (p.left,q.right) and (p.right,q.left) has to be identical.
```
